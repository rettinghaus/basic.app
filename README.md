# ba[sic?] - better authorities [search, identify, connect]


## Introduction

ba[sic?] is a tool for searching, identifying and connecting named entities  with authority data. Currently persistent identifiers from the [GND](http://www.dnb.de/EN/Standardisierung/GND/gnd_node.html) (persons) and [Geonames.org](http://www.geonames.org/) (places) are used.

The main goal of this tool is to give an instance of quality assurance to the process of connecting own data with authority data. This is done by adding a configurable *status* attribute (e.g. *unsafe*, *unavailable*, etc.) and the possibility to set a preferred linked dataset from a list of possible matching datasets.

The tool is facing the problem of fast and comfortable identification of the correct corresponding authority data, if it already exist. Therefor it provides a name based search interfaces to quickly get a list of possible matching datasets and a view for easy comparing the properties of the different results and finally choose and set the preferred one.
